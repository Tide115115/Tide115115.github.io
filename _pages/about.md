About me:
===============

I do 2D art stuff mainly, and this is my website for displaying the best work I've made to date. I graduated with a Bachelor in Animation and Interactive Media from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in 2022 and have been doing personal and commissioned 2D illustration and concept work since then. During the course I was trained in 2D animation, illustration and graphic design, in addition to getting to try out other mediums such as stop motion and paper animation.

After uni, I decided that coming back to Malaysia rather than staying in Australia was what I wanted in the long run. Both for my personal and family life, but also so that I can contribute to the potential media and arts scene of Malaysia, which I'm quite optimistic of overall. Ideally, I would want to collaborate with other likeminded creative individuals in order to do something new and exciting, but I'm open to opportunities as they come.
